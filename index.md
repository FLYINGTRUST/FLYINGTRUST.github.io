A significant challenge in the practical deployment of quadrotor visual navigation is the inconsistent performance observed when a single algorithm is transferred across different physical platforms and operating environments. This gap stems from a fundamental research shortcoming: evaluating algorithms on single, idealized platforms. This practice ignores the joint effect of vehicle kinodynamics and scenario geometry on robustness, making widespread field deployment costly, time-consuming, and high-risk. We introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity, configurable benchmarking framework to systematically quantify this joint effect before deployment. Our framework features two key innovations: 1) A compact, physical model to quantify vehicle capability via maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration, and 2) a standardized evaluation pipeline. This pipeline pairs a heterogeneous library of 36 real and virtual platforms with a diverse scenario library, which includes both classic navigation scenes and novel "stress-test" environments. Using a composite scoring method that penalizes instability, we evaluated representative optimization-based and learning-based planners. The results reveal systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. FLYINGTRUST is the first tool to de-risk development, enabling predictive algorithm selection and highlighting the practical necessity of integrating platform capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and selection to achieve robust performance.

<!-- ## Background
The paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" was published by Alan Turing in 1936. In this groundbreaking paper, Turing introduced the concept of a universal computing machine, now known as the Turing machine.

## Objective
Turing's main objective in this paper was to investigate the notion of computability and its relation to the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem), which is concerned with determining whether a given mathematical statement is provable or not.


## Key Ideas
1. Turing first presented the concept of a "computable number," which refers to a number that can be computed by an algorithm or a definite step-by-step process.
2. He introduced the notion of a Turing machine, an abstract computational device consisting of an infinite tape divided into cells and a read-write head. The machine can read and write symbols on the tape, move the head left or right, and transition between states based on a set of rules.
3. Turing demonstrated that the set of computable numbers is enumerable, meaning it can be listed in a systematic way, even though it is not necessarily countable.
4. He proved the existence of non-computable numbers, which cannot be computed by any Turing machine.
5. Turing showed that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable, meaning there is no algorithm that can determine, for any given mathematical statement, whether it is provable or not. -->

<!-- ## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers. -->
