Autonomous visual navigation is a critical enabler for quadrotors across diverse applications, such as infrastructure inspection, mapping, and disaster response. However, a significant challenge in practical quadrotor navigation is the inconsistent performance observed when a single algorithm is transferred across different physical platforms and operating environments. This gap stems from a fundamental research shortcoming: evaluating algorithms on single, idealized platforms. This practice ignores the joint effect of vehicle kinodynamics and scenario geometry on robustness, making widespread field deployment costly, time-consuming, and high-risk. To avoid these problems, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity, configurable benchmarking framework, to systematically quantify this joint effect before deployment, thereby evaluating algorithm performance and assisting in the design of quadrotor kinodynamic parameters. It integrates a compact physical model of vehicle capability (via maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and angular acceleration) with a standardized evaluation pipeline. This pipeline pairs a heterogeneous library of 36 real and virtual platforms with a diverse scenario library, which includes both classic navigation scenes and novel “stress-test” environments. Using a composite scoring method that penalizes instability, we evaluated representative optimization-based and learning-based planners. The results reveal systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct preferences and failure modes. FLYINGTRUST is the first tool to de-risk development, enabling predictive algorithm selection and informing platform and algorithm co-design to achieve robust performance.

## Background
The Problem: Autonomous quadrotors often exhibit inconsistent performance when transferred to new platforms or environments. Current benchmarks typically evaluate algorithms on single, idealized vehicles, ignoring the critical joint effect of kinodynamics (agility) and scenario geometry on robustness.

Our Solution: FLYINGTRUST is a high-fidelity benchmarking framework that systematically quantifies this joint effect in simulation. It helps researchers identify "brittle" algorithms and de-risk costly field deployments.

## Key Ideas
1. Quantify the Joint Effect: Systematically evaluate how platform capability interacts with scene geometry to determine navigation success, moving beyond isolated perception or planning tests.
2. Kinodynamic Abstraction: A compact physical model using Thrust-to-Weight Ratio and Angular Acceleration to represent a diverse library of 36 heterogeneous platforms (18 Real + 18 Virtual).
3. From Classic to Stress-Tests: A standardized pipeline featuring 7 scenarios: Classic environments (Forest, Urban) for baseline proficiency, and Adversarial cases (Narrow-Gap, Sudden-Drop) to probe specific failure modes.
4. Predictive Analysis: Uses a composite score to penalize instability, enabling predictive algorithm selection and informing the co-design of platforms and algorithms for robust real-world performance.

## Experiments
We evaluated several commonly used and widely deployed visual quadrotor navigation algorithms. For fair comparison, all methods (including the straightflight baseline) use the same start pose. All runs respect identical flight ceilings, maximum speed limits and acceleration constraints.

<!-- ## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers. -->
